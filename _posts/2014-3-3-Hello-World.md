_Learning is a wonderful feeling of accomplishment._ If you learn, think and implement, you win in life. As I am setting a journey into finding out if coding is my niche, coding has thrown wonderful insights about myself. I have found out that if I push myself, I am very disciplined. I have done n number of courses in my favorite areas. I have also learnt through the #FreeApril Pluralsight courses, where it changed my insight that I am not bright. Practice makes anyone bright. 2020 maybe a sad year for everyone, but it has been an insightful year till now for me. 

Here's to discovering more about myself and more coding. Deciding the career path too.
